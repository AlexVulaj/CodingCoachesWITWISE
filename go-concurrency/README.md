# Concurrency in Go

This module shows the progression of a codebase meant to check the reachability of various URLs.

The code here was accompanied by a talk given to [The WIT Network](https://thewitnetwork.com/) as part of their monthly
Coding Coaches sessions. The WIT Network is a global and local Not For Profit organization providing inspiration,
education, mentoring, networking, and practical advice to empower women (and men) to build and grow their careers in
technology and pursue their ambitions.

## Usage

Within each of the files named `[A-G].go`, you'll find a snippet of code along with accompanying comments that explain
what's happening. To run any of the files, open up `main.go` and change the function being called to your desired step.

i.e.

```go
func main() {
C(urlsFile)
}
```

At the end of each function, the program will print out the execution time for the whole process to run.
This serves both to measure the benefits of introducing concurrency in this scenario
and letting us know that our program has finished execution.
